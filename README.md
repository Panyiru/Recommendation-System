# Recommendation-System
This repo is for COMP90050 Advanced Database Project--Recommendation System. Please refer Juypter notebook RS.ipynb for code implementation and related graphs.
We demonstrate 4 models, including popularity model, content-based model, colloborative filtering model and hybrid model, and use recall rate as metric to evaluate performance of each model.
